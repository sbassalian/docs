## Welcome

Welcome to the Growi API documentation. Here you will find all the information you need to interact with the Growi platform through our API. You can build comprehensive affiliate management solutions and integrate seamlessly with our services.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. To authenticate your requests, you need to include the Authorization header with your API key.

To authenticate, pass up an Authorization header with the value:<br/>`Bearer <api-key>`:

```json
Base Url https://api.growi.io/api/public/v1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
