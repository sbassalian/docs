description: "Receive notifications when creators are added or removed from campaigns"

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You need administrative access to your Growi dashboard to configure webhook URLs.
</Info>

## Overview

When a brand has a **Webhook URL** configured, Growi will send an **HTTP POST** request with a JSON body whenever a campaign's creator affiliation changes state.

## Configuration

In the Organization settings, configure:

- **Webhook URL**: A single HTTPS URL that will receive webhook POST requests.

## Event Types

The webhook payload includes an `event` field to differentiate between actions:

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `campaign_affiliate.activated` | Creator was **added/activated** on the campaign |
| `campaign_affiliate.removed` | Creator was **removed** from the campaign |
| `campaign_affiliate.left` | Creator **left** the campaign |

<Note>
  If the system encounters an unknown status, it will fall back to `campaign_affiliate.<status>`.
</Note>

## Delivery Details

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **Content-Type** | `application/json` |
| **Connect Timeout** | 10 seconds |
| **Read Timeout** | 10 seconds |
| **Success Criteria** | Any `2xx` response |
| **Retries** | Up to 3 retries on failure |

Non-2xx responses are treated as failures and will be retried.

## Payload Format

The request body is a single JSON object with the following fields:

<ResponseField name="event" type="string" required>
  Event name that indicates what happened.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="occurred_at" type="string" required>
  ISO-8601 timestamp of the underlying record update.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Not Being Received">
    Ensure your webhook URL is correctly configured in Organization settings and is publicly accessible over HTTPS.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Receiving Duplicate Events">
    Implement idempotency in your webhook handler using the `campaign_affiliate_id` and `occurred_at` fields to deduplicate events.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Failing with Timeout">
    Your endpoint must respond within 10 seconds. Consider processing webhooks asynchronously and returning a 200 response immediately.
