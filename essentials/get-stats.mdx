# How to Access Growi Statistics

Follow these steps to set up authentication and start accessing Growi's statistics endpoints.

## 1. Generate Your API Key

First, navigate to the "Settings" section of your Growi dashboard, then click on the "Developer" tab. Here you can create a new API key for accessing the statistics endpoints.

    alt="Navigate to Developer Settings"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## 2. Copy Your API Key

Once you've created your API key, you can copy it to use in your API requests. Keep this key secure and don't share it publicly.

    alt="Copy API Key"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## 3. Making Authenticated Requests

To make requests to any of our stats endpoints, you'll need to include your API key in the Authorization header using Bearer authentication:

```bash
Base URL: https://api.growi.io/api/public/v1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
