# How to Set Up Stripe with Growi

In a few simple steps, you can set up Growi with your Stripe integration to track affiliates. We also have an open-source example [here](https://github.com/Growi-Inc/stripe-integration-example).

## 1. Authenticate Your Stripe Account with Growi

Navigate to the “Settings” tab, then the “Integrations & Socials” section, and finally click “Install Now” on the Stripe integration.

    alt="Stripe Integration Setup"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## 2. Add Our Tracking Script

Add the following script to your app:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://cdn.growi.io/growi.js"
  data-growi="{YOUR_PUBLIC_GROWI_ID}"
/>
```

You can get your “Public Growi ID” from the dashboard on the “Integrations &
Socials” page.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe2.png"
    alt="Public Growi ID"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## 3. Send Affiliate Code to Stripe The tracking script will capture users

navigating to your site with affiliate parameters and save them to
window.growi.affiliate_code. You must pass the affiliate code to the Stripe
metadata using the growi_affiliate_code key.

```js
const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price: "price_nj8h23ud",
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  metadata: {
    growi_affiliate_code: window.growi.affiliate_code,
  },
});
```

React Example For those using React, we have
a repository demonstrating our Stripe integration: [React Stripe Integration
Example](https://github.com/Growi-Inc/stripe-integration-example).

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when setting
up Stripe with Growi.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stripe Integration Not Appearing">
    Ensure you have administrative access and have navigated to the correct
    section in the Growi dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tracking Script Not Capturing Affiliate Code">
    Verify that the script is correctly added to your app and that the Public
    Growi ID is correct.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Affiliate Code Not Being Sent to Stripe">
    Double-check your implementation of passing the affiliate code to Stripe
    metadata. Ensure `window.growi.affiliate_code` is being captured and used
    correctly.
